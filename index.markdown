## Introduction

This portfolio's main purpose is to present projects implemented during my studies for Master degree in "Design for Immersive and Creative Technologies" at Stockholm University years 2019-2021. In all of the projects I took equally active part in ideation and was responsible for implementation in Unity.

## Master thesis - Sound Globe

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}assets/images/design_inreaction.png" class="center"> 

Culmination of the studies was my thesis work, where I explored novel Soma Design method informing design of the virtual experience through my own body. An immersive experience Sound Globe was created using Soma Design as
a part of this research through design study. The experience extends user's
presence into a virtual environment where they can touch the Sound Globe,
and by moving expressively produce music. Designe with Unity and executed as a stereoscopic projection. More information.

## Collaborative SharedVR

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}assets/images/SharedVR.png" class="center"> 

In this project we explored possibility to immerse users in a shared VR experience through a tablet to accompany players with VR-helmets in their escapades. The tablet serves as a window in the virtual world, and tablet-user's position is being updated in real time matching their physical movements. They are also empowered by ability to interact with the objects. To test and demonstrate this idea we designed a short gamified challenge for the users to solve collaboratively. This project was done for Ericsson as an external stakeholder, therefore users start in the fika room where they greet each other.

## Morphosis XR

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}assets/images/morphosis.png" class="center">

In this project we combined VR experience with a physical experience of being restricted in a ‘cocoon’. A user was wrapped in the jacket and immersed inside of the virtual cocoon in the middle of the surrealistic night forest. Later they release themselves and able to fly with their newly gained gigantic butterfly wings.

## Crossroad simulation study

Simulation of Nybroplan crossroad in Stockholm was created in Unity as a part of the course dedicated to study of Digital Twins concept. Using AI tools available in Unity we simulated different setups of the crossroad in the future with alternative to today's technology.

## CatConnect - feeder and entertain center for Cats and their owners

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}assets/images/CatConnect.png" class="center">

A solution in a context of smart home where both cat and their owners are users. Using sensors and actuators connected to Raspberry Pi we created a prototype of a feeder and laser toy for cats which is controlled from anywhere through a dedicated Android app.

## Magic Wall
This is the very first project done during the master program. Here user observes themselve inside the virtuality in an full-size display wall. The system tracks the user in physical space and adapts the virtual reality. In this case a bird was flying towards the user and attempted to sit on their shoulder. The system was running on a smartphone and built in Unity.

### Demo of the technology
