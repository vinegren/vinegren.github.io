## Itroduction
This portfolio's main purpose is to present projects implemented during my studies for Master degree in "Design for Immersive and Creative Technologies" at Stockholm University years 2019-2021. 
<hr>

Culmination of the studies was my thesis work, where I explored novel Soma Design method informing design of the virtual experience through my own body. An immersive experience Sound Globe was created using Soma Design as
a part of this research through design study. The experience extends user's
presence into a virtual environment where they can touch the Sound Globe,
and by moving expressively produce music.
